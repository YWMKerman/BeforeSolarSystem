		#BSS_Sun_name = The Sun
		#BSS_Sun_desc = A newborn star. This star system has just stabilized and there are endless possibilities in the future.

		#ASS_001 = Through the porthole, you look down at the newborn star: a white, billowing plasma, beyond which occasional powerful flares erupt. \nWe should probably wait until it calms down before coming back.
		#ASS_002 = When you leave a planet's atmosphere, you can notice the true color of the Sun, a star that emits nearly white light. Although its current luminosity is still very low, it has not completely entered a stable stage.  But I still recommend wearing sunglasses to gaze at it.
		#ASS_003 = You feel a huge force of gravity that presses you firmly onto the chair. No matter how soft your chair is, it cannot slow down the force of gravity. \nAt the same time, the temperature outside the spacecraft is soaring rapidly...
		#ASS_004 = You feel the temperature rising a bit, so you decide to turn the cooling knob a little higher. At the same time, you lower the knob and observe the edge of the sun, trying to observe a coronal mass ejection.
		#ASS_005 = What are you looking at as you float in the distant orbit of the sun? \n The Milky Way? Or a planet? Or a comet that breaks into the solar system? \n You notice that there seems to be a faint bright spot in the distance slowly passing through your field of vision. Maybe it is an asteroid that was previously thrown out of orbit by Jupiter.
		#ASS_006 = I feel that the situation is very dangerous at the moment. We have to return to the spacecraft.
		#ASS_008 = You point your telescope at the dark universe and begin observing the Milky Way; this may help us discover some new stars, brown dwarfs, or help us discover potentially dangerous asteroids.
		#ASS_009 = You arrived at an asteroid and collected a precious sample from a distant solar system. These samples may contain solid water and organic matter; this may help us better understand the evolution of the solar system.

        #ASS_Cupid_Biome7 = Polar Regions

        #ASS_Cupid_name = Cupid
		#ASS_Cupid_desc = The huge demon moon hanging in the sky is becoming increasingly unstable. It is affected by the tides from the sun and Venus itself. It is currently approaching Venus rapidly at a rate of several centimeters per year. Before long, it will collide with Venus, which may completely change the fate of that planet.

		#BSS_Mars_name = Mars
		#BSS_Mars_desc = According to long-standing records, the planet's magnetic field is slowly weakening over time. Currently, its magnetic field strength has been reduced to about half of what it was hundreds of millions of years ago. \nThis situation may be a death curse for the planet, indicating that the planet's iron-nickel core is cooling, and perhaps there is not much time left for the planet.
